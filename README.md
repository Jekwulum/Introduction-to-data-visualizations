## Introduction

> * We aren't naturally good at storytelling with data***
In school we learn a lot about language and math. On the language side, we learn how to put words together into sentences and into stories. With math we learn to make sense of numbers. But it's rare that these sides are paired: no one teaches us how to tell stories with numbers. Adding to the challenge, very few people feel naturally adept in this space.

There is a story in your data. But your tools don't know what that story is so you want to shift from simply showing data to storytelling with data 

Practical guidance that you can begin using immediately to better communicate visually with data :- 
1 - understand the context.
2- choose an appropriate visual display.
3- Eliminate clutter.
4- focus attention where you want it.
5- think like a designer.
6- Tell a story


## About this nootbook

> Let’s see the main libraries for data visualization with Python and all the types of charts that can be done with them. We will also see which library is recommended to use on each occasion and the unique capabilities of each library.

## Prerequisites
	- Jupyter Notebook
	- Python 3
	- Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Pandas Profiling

## Installing
> Instructions to install Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/install

## Conclusion
> For the initial phases of a project, with pandas and pandas profiling we will make a quick visualization to understand the data. If we need to visualize more information we could use simple graphs that we can find in matplotlib as scatterplots or histograms.
For advanced phases of the project, we can search the galleries of the main libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, Plotly) for the graphics that we like and fit the project. These graphics can be used to give information in reports, make interactive reports, search for specific values, …
